I'm building a Lua interpreter in C++. I might make a compiler for wasm too. Who knows.

I'm also learning C++ so it's gonna be bad

## A Year Later
I haven't done much with this project since the brief burst of inspiration and determination I had when I first started it. It is by no means finished. It functions reasonably well as a Lua lexer, but does little if anything beyond that. I still have an interest in compilers / interpreters so I might pick this back up one day, but for now it's probably not going to be worked on.
